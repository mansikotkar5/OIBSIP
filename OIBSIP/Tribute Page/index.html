            missile development efforts. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's 
            Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974. Kalam was elected 
            as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition
